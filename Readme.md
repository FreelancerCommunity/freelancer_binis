# Freelancer Bini's in Ini Format

This repo contains:
* `bini.exe`, a little commandline program by Mario Brito that converts Freelancer bini files to human-readable ini.
* `convert_all.sh`, a script I wrote that will take a Freelancer `DATA` directory and duplicate its folder layout with all `.ini` files made human-readable (Warning: It ain't quick. I made it with the intention of only running it once).
* `DATA`, containing all `.ini` files found in the Freelancer 1.0/1.1 `DATA` directory (as found on the original game disc) converted into human-readable `.ini`.
